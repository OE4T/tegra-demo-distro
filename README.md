# tegra-demo-distro

Reference/demo distribution for NVIDIA Jetson platforms
using Yocto Project tools and the meta-tegra BSP layer.

## Prerequisites

See the [Yocto Project Quick Build](https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/3.1.2/brief-yoctoprojectqs/brief-yoctoprojectqs.html)
documentation for information on setting up your build host.
In addition to the packages mentioned in that documentation, you
will need gcc and g++ 8 (on Ubuntu, packages `gcc-8` and `g++-8`).

For burning SDcards (for the Jetson Nano or Jetson Xavier NX developer
kits), the `bmap-tools` package is recommended.

For building CUDA applications, you must download the CUDA host-side
tools using the NVIDIA SDK Manager (NVIDIA Developer Network login
required). You should set the environment variable NVIDIA_DEVNET_MIRROR
to the path of the directory where the `.deb` file for the tools
package is located.

## Setting up

1. Clone this repository:

        $ git clone -b dunfell-l4t-r32.4.3 https://github.com/OE4T/tegra-demo-distro.git

2. Initialize the git submodules:

        $ cd tegra-demo-distro
		$ git submodule update --init

3. Source the `setup-env` script to create a build directory,
   specifying the MACHINE you want to configure as the default
   for your builds. For example, to set up a build directory
   called `build` that is set up for the Jetson Xavier NX
   developer kit and the default `tegrademo` distro:

        $ . ./setup-env --machine jetson-xavier-nx-devkit

   You can get a complete list of available options, MACHINE
   names, and DISTRO names with

        $ . ./setup-env --help

4. Optional: Install pre-commit hook for commit autosigning using
        $ ./scripts-setup/setup-pre-commit-hook.sh

## Distributions

Use the `--distro` option with `setup-env` to specify a distribution for your build,
or customize the DISTRO setting in your `$BUILDDIR/conf/local.conf` to reference one
of the supported distributions.

Currently supported distributions are listed below:


| Distribution name | Description                                                   |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| tegrademo         | Default distro used to demonstrate/test meta-tegra features   |
| tegrademo-mender  | Adds [mender](https://www.mender.io/) OTA support             |


## Images

The `tegrademo` distro includes the following image recipes, which
are dervied from the `core-image-XXX` recipes in OE-Core but configured
for Jetson platforms. They include some additional test tools and
demo applications.
