# Mender, for some reason, decided that libubootenv should supply the
# fw_env.config file, rather than keeping libubootenv generic and
# having the already platform-dependent u-boot recipe supply both
# that config file and the initial environment file, as was intended.
# We'll need the initial environment file to support bootloader
# updates that relocate the u-boot environment storage location,
# so remove this RPROVIDES so it can be supplied by the u-boot
# recipe.  The config file is still provided by this recipe,
# however.

# Also stash an extra copy of the fw_env.config file in the
# rootfs so we can compare it to the currently-installed one
# in a state script, to see if we need to take steps to save
# and restore u-boot environment variables during a bootloader
# update.
