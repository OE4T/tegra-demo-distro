# Swupdate for NVIDIA Tegra (Jetson) platforms

This dynamic layer provides an example implementation for
Nvidia Jetson and [swupdate](https://sbabic.github.io/swupdate).

The simplest way to use on tegra is to add to a forked copy of
[tegra-demo-distro](https://github.com/OE4T/tegra-demo-distro) which
also contains relevant images and submodules used to build tegra images.
However, this is not strictly required.  The only dependency required
is the [meta-tegra](https://github.com/OE4T/meta-tegra) layer.

## Build with KAS

The files under [conf/kas](conf/kas) support building with
the [kas](https://kas.readthedocs.io/).

The setups here represent the last configuration tested.

### Install kas
```
pip3 install kas
```

### Build with kas

Use the scripts at [scripts](scripts), for instance

```
./scripts/build-jetson-orin-nano-devkit-nvme.sh
```
to build for the jetson-orin-nano-devkit-nvme `MACHINE` on the
default branch configuration.

The default build will build for whatever branch of this
repository you've cloned and latest branch of corresponding
repositories.

To build the latest tested configuration instead, use kas
build to specify the swupdate-oe4t-lasttested.yml file from
the base directory, for instance:

```
kas build layers/meta-tegrademo/dynamic-layers/meta-swupdate/conf/kas/swupdate-oe4t-lasttested.yml
```
You may need to modify the machine setting or set KAS_MACHINE appropriately.


## Build with tegra-demo-distro

Use these instructions to add to tegra-demo-distro on whatever
branch you'd like to target (kirkstone and later are supported).

```
cd repos
git submodule add https://github.com/sbabic/meta-swupdate
cd ../layers
ln -s ../repos/meta-swupdate
```

Then use the `setup-env` script to start a bitbake shell, and add
this layer to your build
```
bitbake-layers add-layer ../layers/meta-swupdate
```

In your local.conf (or distro/machine configuration) add
these lines:
```
IMAGE_INSTALL:append = " swupdate"
USE_REDUNDANT_FLASH_LAYOUT = "1"
IMAGE_FSTYPES:append = " tar.gz"
```
If you desire an image other than demo-image-base as your base image,
you may add a definition for `SWUPDATE_CORE_IMAGE_NAME` with the
desired base image.

Finally, build the update image using:
```
bitbake swupdate-image-tegra
```

## Deploy and Test
* Tegraflash the inital image (demo-image-base or, whatever
image you've set as `SWUPDATE_CORE_IMAGE_NAME`
* Deploy the .swu file built with swupdate-image-tegra
to the target
* Run the update with:
```
swupdate -i </path/to/swu/file>
```
* Reboot to apply the update.
  * The root partition should change
  * The `nvbootctrl dump-slots-info` output should show boot
from the alternate boot slot with `Capsule update status:1`.

# Build Options

The tegra_swupdate.bbclass contains global configuration options
for the swupdate demo.

## TEGRA_SWUPDATE_BOOTLOADER_INSTALL_ONLY_IF_DIFFERENT

Set
```
TEGRA_SWUPDATE_BOOTLOADER_INSTALL_ONLY_IF_DIFFERENT = "true"
```
in your local.conf or layer to only run the capsule update when
a different bootloader version is detected in the alternate slot,
where bootloader version is set based on ${L4T_VERSION} but can
be modified by overriding variable `TEGRA_SWUPDATE_BOOTLOADER_VERSION`

When this variable is set, the capsule payload will not be installed
as a part of the update when the alternate partition is found to contain
the same bootloader release version (rootfs was built with the same
value of `TEGRA_SWUPDATE_BOOTLOADER_VERSION`.  Instead, the rootfs
will be switched to the alternate rootfs.
